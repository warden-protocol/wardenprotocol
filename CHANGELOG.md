<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry is required to include a tag and
the GitHub issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The tag should consist of where the change is being made ex. (x/staking), (store)
The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"Consensus Breaking CHANGES" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

### Features

* (wardend) Add `wardend genesis add-genesis-space` and `wardend genesis add-genesis-keychain` commands to prepare the genesis file
* (wardend) analyzers smart contract: a way for 3rd party builders to provide metadata to shield's intents during new signature requests
* (wardend) Initial version Ethereum analyzer
    * can be used to pass an Ethereum unsigned transaction, and will return the correct DataForSigning
* (faucet/v2) New web-based version of the faucet that uses recaptcha.
* (faucet/v2) UI/UX tweaks.
* (x/warden) [#377](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/377) Add `keychain_fees` field to `MsgUpdateKeychain` message
* (x/warden) Remove Keychain.AdminIntentId field. This field was used to choose an Intent for operations, but it was never used.
* (x/warden) Add autogenerated CLI subcommands for `MsgNewAction`. These make it easier to send transactions such as AddSpaceOwner, etc.
* (x/warden) Add an option EncryptionKey to SignRequests. If set, the Keychain is requested to encrypt the signature before sending it back to the Warden Protocol.
    * This is useful for users who want to keep their signatures private, allowing them to use in dApps such as dYdX, where the signature is used to "login".
* (x/warden) Remove deprecated `SignMethod` field from `MsgNewSignatureRequest`. Use analyzers instead.
* (x/act) Fix bug for Rules hooks not having the creator of the Action in the context
* (x/act) Added a new MsgCheckAction for manually re-checking the action rule status 
* (x/act) Added Export/Import for the State the module (`Rules`, `Actions`)

* (x/warden) Fix KeyRequests query when KeychainId filter is not set
* (x/warden) Fix SignRequests query when KeychainId filter is not set
* (x/warden) Ensure that SpacesByOwner index is updated when an owner is removed

### Misc

* (shield) Improved error messages when parsing an unknown token type
* (shield) Add unit tests for AST preprocessor
* (x/warden) Rename Keychain "parties" to "writers" for clarity, as they are the only ones that can write on-chain data on behalf of the Keychain.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2024-03-26

### Consensus Breaking Changes

* (x/warden) [#77](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/77) Use uint64 IDs for Space and Keychain, instead of string bech32 addresses
* (x/act) [#55](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/55) Initial release of the `shield` intent engine, replacing the old `boolparser` and cleaning up the API
* (x/act) [#112](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/112) Store a list of referenced addresses when a new intent is created. This is useful for querying all intents that reference a given address.
* Refactor of `x/act`'s and `x/warden`'s store design to improve queries performance:
    * (x/act) [#117](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/117) Pin the intent definition when an Action is created instead of just referencing it. This allows faster queries "by address" by storing the list of addresses directly inside the action, instead of having to re-evaluate the linked intent for each action.
    * (x/warden) [#121](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/121) Separate Keys queries into `AllKeys`, `KeysBySpaceId`, and `KeyById`. This allowed some improvements, especially in the `KeysBySpaceId` that can benefit from a new "space id -> key id" index.
    * (x/warden) [#122](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/122) Improve `SpacesByOwner` query by adding a new "owner -> space id" index.

### Features

* (client) [#116](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/116) Add `warden q wait-tx` command to wait for a transaction to be included in a block
    * The same command was submitted to Cosmos SDK: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19870
* (clichain) [#113](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/113) Initial release of `clichain`, a CLI for acting as a Keychain from the command line
* (x/warden) [#109](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/109) Add ability to assign an intent to a key, overriding the SignIntent of the Space
    * [#110](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/110) Add MsgUpdateKey for updating a key's intent
* (keychain-sdk) [#92](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/92) Increase Keychain SDK's throughput by batching requests into a single transaction
* (snap) [#83](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/83) Initial release of Warden Protocol's MetaMask snap
* (build) [#69](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/69) Add Makefile for building `wardend`
* (faucet) [#99](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/99) Rate limit faucet requests by IP address, not only by account
* (faucet) [#66](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/pull/66) Batch multiple faucet request in a single transaction

### Bug Fixes
