## Overview

The main part of any Omnichain Application is a smart contract that allows signing transactions and messages at any destination chain. This section contains links to resources you can use for deploying Omnichain Contracts of two types:

- **EVM** contracts written in **Solidity**, charged by Evmos
- **CosmWasm** contracts written in **Rust**
