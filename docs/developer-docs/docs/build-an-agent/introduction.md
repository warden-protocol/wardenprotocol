# Introduction

## Warden AI Agents

Warden Protocol allows you to develop **Warden Agents**—AI-driven programs that support both offchain and onchain operations.

Thanks to their native integration with Warden Protocol, Warden Agents can perform onchain [Actions](/learn/glossary#action), such as creating [Spaces](/learn/glossary#space), generating [keys](/learn/glossary#key), executing transactions, and managing [Orders](build-an-onchain-ai-agent/introduction).

You can easily build Agents with the [Warden Agent Kit](warden-agent-kit/introduction).

To learn more about Warden Agents and how they integrate with AI, see [Warden AI Agents](/learn/warden-ai-agents) and [SPEX](/learn/spex).
