# Introduction

**$WARD** is the native utility token for the Warden Protocol's ecosystem, sitting at the heart of both [Warden Chain](/learn/glossary#warden-chain) and [Warden](/learn/glossary#warden).

$WARD is designed to facilitate various operations—such as governance, staking, rewards—and to serve as a medium of payment for any developer publishing an [Agent](/learn/glossary#ai-agent) on Warden. For [Warden](/learn/glossary#warden), it'll act as a gas abstraction token and unlock gated functionality, including future subscription tiers.
