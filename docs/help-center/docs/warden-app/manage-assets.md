## Send or swap assets

Before sending or swapping an asset, make sure your [wallet is funded](#deposit-assets) in a network where you wish to perform a transaction. Then take these steps:

1. [Create a new chat](use-the-ai-assistant) with the AI assistant. Alternatively, initiate a conversation by clicking **Send** in your wallet.
2. Ask the assistant to send or swap an asset.
3. Provide all the required details and confirm the transaction in the chat.
4. The assistant will share the transaction details with you. You can always find them in your [activity history](manage-your-wallet#view-the-balance-and-activity).
