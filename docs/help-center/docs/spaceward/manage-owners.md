# Manage owners

## Overview

A [Space](manage-spaces) can have multiple **owners**, identified by their Warden addresses.

Here are the main rules of Space ownership:

- When you create a Space, you become its default owner.
- You can invite other SpaceWard users to co-own and co-manage your Space
- Other Space creators can also add you to their Spaces.
- Only the Space creator can add or remove additional Space owners.

## Add or remove an owner

To add a new owner, take these steps:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org).
2. Navigate to the top-left corner of the screen and click **Owners**.
3. Click **New Owner**.
4. Specify the Warden address and name.
5. Click **Add owner** and approve the transaction in your connected wallet.

:::tip
Each owner is identified by Warden address – an address that is assigned to a SpaceWard user after [connecting a wallet](connect-your-wallet). To check your address, click its icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

To remove an owner, just click it, then click **Remove**, and approve in your wallet.
