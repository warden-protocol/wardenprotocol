# Interoperability

:::important
This feature is under active development. Stay tuned for upcoming guides on how to interact with Warden through Hyperlane.
:::

## Overview

**Interoperability** is the ability of different blockchains to communicate and exchange data or assets. Warden supports it through integration with **Hyperlane**, a leading modular interoperability framework.

This collaboration makes the output from Warden's [AVR Plugins](glossary#avr-plugin) universally accessible across 150+ blockchains—from Ethereum and Solana to Cosmos-based ecosystems and beyond. This enables developers to access verifiable AI anywhere.

## Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz) is a first permissionless interoperability layer that allows smart contract developers to send arbitrary data across over 150 blockchains. It empowers developers to connect any chain and build applications that can easily and securely communicate between multiple blockchains.

## Available chains

Currently Hyperlane provides [150 connected chains](https://hyperlane.xyz/expansion). This number may change over the course of time as more chains are added.
