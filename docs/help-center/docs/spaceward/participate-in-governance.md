# Participate in governance

## Overview

After [staking](stake-ward) your [WARD tokens](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/ward-token/ward), you can **participate in governance**, which means voting on new proposals for the Warden protocol. It's possible only while your tokens are bonded (staked).

Your voting power depends on the total amount of staked WARD. The more you stake, the stronger is your voice!

## Vote

To cast a vote, take these steps:

1. Connect to SpaceWard: 👉 [SpaceWard on Chiado](https://spaceward.chiado.wardenprotocol.org/)
2. In the left menu, navigate to **Governance**. You'll see a list of proposals.
3. Click an active proposal to open its details.
4. Click **Vote** and then select the option you wish to vote for.
5. Approve the transaction in your connected wallet.
