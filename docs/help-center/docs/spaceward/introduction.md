## Transaction flow

SpaceWard allows you to securely carry out operations across multiple blockchains.

You need to create a **key** (wallet) associated with a certain **Keychain** – a custodian that generates and stores keys and signs transactions. The Keychain will sign your transaction only it meets the **Approval Rule** you created. Learn more: [Glossary: Keychain](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/learn/glossary#keychain).

This is how it works:

1. You can initiate a transaction from your preferred decentralized application (dApp).
2. Upon initiation, the transaction passes through Approval Rules.
3. If approval is granted, the system requests a signature from the Keychain.
4. Once signed, the transaction is then broadcast to its network.
