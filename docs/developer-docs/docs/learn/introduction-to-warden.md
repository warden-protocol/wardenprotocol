# Introduction to Warden

## The Warden Protocol

The **Warden Protocol** is a L1 blockchain bringing AI to Web3 and enabling any application, protocol, or smart contract to integrate **safe AI**.

Mass adoption of Web3 requires the creation of safe and seamless AI experiences, and Warden empowers developers to achieve this goal.

## AI Blockchain Interface

Warden supports **AIBI**—**Artificial Intelligence Blockchain Interface**

AIBI brings AI onchain with an intuitive interface for developers to integrate AI into their applications. Inspired by proof-of-computation and computational pipelines, AIBI allows inference endpoints to create cryptographic proofs that verify that an AI model produced a specific prediction. These proofs are then verified on Wardens’ blockchain through a new consensus mechanism, ensuring AI outputs are not just delivered, but can be trusted.

Within Warden, AI is integrated on two layers:

- **Verification layer**  
Warden is designed to bring AIs onchain safely. Our verification layer uses blockchain, cryptography, and consensus to verify AI results are correct.

- **Execution layer**  
Easily integrate AI with your application, protocols, and smart contracts. Automate their execution across any chain. Learn more: [Build an Agent](/build-an-agent/introduction).

## Key protocol features

Warden's key features allow creating a truly open AI experience:

- **AI-ready**  
Warden allows you to easily [build AI Agents](/build-an-agent/introduction) and enjoy novel AI-driven Web3 experiences.

- **Simplified cryptography**  
With Warden, you can easily develop Web3 applications with [Intent-driven](/learn/glossary#intent) key management.

- **Abstracted interoperability**  
Build applications that allow aggregating multiple accounts for different chains and signing transactions at any destination chain.

## Build with Warden

Warden provides operator sets and integrations with leading wallets, explorers, bridges, oracles, and more, so developers can focus on what matters most: building products.

Here is what you can do with Warden:

- **Build an Agent**  
Warden allows you to unleash new user experiences by integrating AI into your application, protocol, or smart contract. With the [`x/async` Warden module](/learn/warden-protocol-modules/x-async), you can create smart contracts utilizing outputs of AI models and [build onchain AI Agents](/build-an-agent/introduction) with custom logic.

- **Build an application**  
[Omnichain Applications (OApps)](/learn/glossary#omnichain-application) are smart contracts that allow signing transactions at any chain. An example of an OApp is [SpaceWard](/learn/glossary#spaceward)—our application functioning as the front-end interface for the protocol. You can deploy EVM-compatible OApps with Solidity or Rust & CosmWasm.

- **Operate a Keychain**  
[Keychains](/learn/glossary#keychain) are custodians that generate and store keys and sign transactions. Since Keychains can sign transactions on virtually any chain, they help avoid manual cross-chain coordination. You can become a Keychain operator or build a custom Keychain.

- **Run a validator node**  
You can run a [validator](/learn/glossary#validator) node and earn rewards while securing Warden’s network.
