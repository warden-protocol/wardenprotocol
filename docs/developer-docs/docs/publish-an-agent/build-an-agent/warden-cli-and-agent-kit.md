### CLI Commands

### Agent models 

When creating an Agent, you'll be prompted to select one of the supported Agent model:

- **OpenAI + Streaming**: A GPT-powered Agent with streaming responses
- **OpenAI + Multi-turn**: A GPT-powered Agent with conversation history
- **Blank + Streaming**: A minimal streaming Agent that echoes input
- **Blank + Multi-turn**: A minimal multi-turn conversation agent

This guide will focus on creating a **GPT-powered Agent** for the sake of quick onboarding.

If you choose **Blank** when creating an Agent, you can use it with any preferred LLM.
