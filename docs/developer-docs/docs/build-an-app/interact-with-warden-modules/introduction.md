# Introduction

You can interact with [Warden Protocol modules](/category/warden-protocol-modules) in your EVM smart contract by calling [Warden precompiles](/category/precompiles).

To familiarize yourself with precompiles, take the following steps:

1. Deploy a simple EVM contract by following the [Get started](get-started) guide.
3. After that, you can expand your contract code as shown in these subsections:
   - [Interact with x/warden](/category/interact-with-xwarden)
   - *Other modules: coming soon*
4. For an overview of available functions, refer to the [Precompiles](/category/precompiles) section.

In this table, you can find all the resources you'll need to interact with each precompile:

|  Functions                                    | Code samples                                              | Precompile address                           |
