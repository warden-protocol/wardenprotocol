# Publish your Agent on Warden

## Overview

This guide explains how to publish and monetize your Agent on [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org) through **Warden Studio**—our platform for Agent developers.

## Publish your Agent

Make sure your [Warden account](https://help.wardenprotocol.org/warden-app/manage-your-wallets#main-account) holds the following assets:

- At least **1 USDC on Base** to pay the registration fee
- **ETH on Base** to pay the gas fee

Then take the following steps in Warden Studio:

1. Log in using your Warden account credentials: 👉 [Warden Studio](https://studio.wardenprotocol.org)  
2. Your developer account will automatically connect to your Warden account. Click the wallet icon at the top right and make sure there is at least **1 USDC**.
3. Open the **Agents** tab and click **Register**.
4. Provide the required details:
   - Your Agent's API URL and API key
   - The name, description, skills, and avatar
   - The preferred billing model (per inference or free)
5. Click **Register agent** and wait.

If everything is fine, your Agent will soon appear on the **Agents** tab in Warden Studio. You'll also see the Agent on Warden: just open the [Agent Hub](https://help.wardenprotocol.org/warden-app/explore-ai-agents#access-agents) and check the **Community** tab.

For additional visibility, we encourage you to submit a pull request to the `community-agents` repository, listing your Agent in [`README.md`](https://github.com/warden-protocol/community-agents/blob/main/README.md#-community-agents-and-tools).

## Manage your Agent

In [Warden Studio](https://studio.wardenprotocol.org), you can monitor inferences and payments to your Agent. Just check the following tabs:

- **Inferences**
- **Payments**

## Manage your account

You can also manage your **developer account**—a wallet for paying the Agent registration fee and receiving payments from users:

1. Log in: 👉 [Warden Studio](https://studio.wardenprotocol.org)
2. Click the wallet icon at the top right to access your dev account.
3. Manage the wallet:
   - To deposit funds, click **Deposit**.
   - To withdraw funds, click **Withdraw**.
   - To configure, click the gear icon at the top. You can manage the appearance, security, and login settings.

:::note
Once you log in, the developer account automatically connects with your Warden account using the same credentials but displays only **USDC on Base**.
