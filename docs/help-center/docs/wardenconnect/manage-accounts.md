# Manage accounts

## Overview

To start using WardenConnect, you need to create an **account** (profile).

There are two types of accounts available:

- **Basic**: It allows you to use WardenConnect as a wallet.
- **Pro**: It allows you to create [Spaces](manage-spaces), [keys](manage-keys), and use other features.

You can create multiple accounts and switch between them.
