# Stake WARD

## Overview

You can **stake** your [WARD tokens](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/ward-token/ward) in SpaceWard. Staking allows you to earn **daily rewards** and directly [participate in governance](participate-in-governance). The more you stake, the more rewards and voting power you receive!

This section explains how to stake WARD and then to redelegate your stake, claim rewards, stake more, or unstake.

:::note
When you [stake](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/learn/glossary#staking) tokens, you [delegate](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/learn/glossary#delegator) them to a preferred [validator](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/learn/glossary#validator) acting on your behalf. Learn more: [How to choose a validator?](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/operate-a-node/delegation-plan#how-to-choose-a-validator)

## Stake

To stake WARD, do the following:

1. Connect to SpaceWard:
   - 👉 [SpaceWard on Buenavista](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org/)

## Manage your stake

After staking, you can claim your rewards or stake more at any time, including restaking your rewards.
