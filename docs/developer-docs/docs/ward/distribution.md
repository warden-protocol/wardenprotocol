## Overview

Note that $WARD distribution will be characterized by the following:

- **Fair launch mechanism**: The WARD token distribution will adopt a fair launch mechanism. This approach ensures a wide and equitable distribution of tokens, preventing market manipulation and ensuring a rapid distribution of stakeholders and community governance.
  
- **Prioritization of active users and supporters**: active users of any application or infra within the Warden ecosystem will be recognized ongoing support, along with other eligible protocols and platforms that have contributed to the foundations and culture that has given Warden Protocol the ability to launch.
