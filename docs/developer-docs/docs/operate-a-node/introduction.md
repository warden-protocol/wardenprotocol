# Introduction

## Warden Protocol nodes

A Warden Protocol node is a server running the software (binary) of Warden Protocol.

Reasons for running a node include the following:

- Accessing archive data
- Providing services: RPC, GRPC, API, etc.
- Becoming a [validator](/learn/glossary#validator)

## Section overview

- [Delegation plan](delegation-plan)  
  Here you can learn about our delegation plan.

- [Run a local chain](run-a-local-chain)  
  Follow this guide if you wish to run a local chain for testing purposes.

- [Chiado testnet](chiado-testnet/chiado-overview), [Buenavista testnet](buenavista-testnet/buenavista-overview)  
  These sections cover our testnets. To get started, follow [Join Chiado](chiado-testnet/join-chiado).  
  Please note that we've sunsetted Buenavista. 

- [Create a validator](create-a-validator), [Operate Skip:Connect](operate-skip-connect)    
  After joining a network, you can become a validator and run the oracle service integrated with Warden.

- [Node API reference](node-api-reference), [Node commands](node-commands)  
  To interact with the node, use the Node API and node commands.
