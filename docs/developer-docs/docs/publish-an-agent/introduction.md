# Introduction

## Community Agents

**Warden Agents** are AI-driven programs registered on Warden Chain. They turn simple chat commands into complex Web3 and Web2 actions: bridging, minting, trading, staking, research. Users can access these Agents in our application, [Warden](https://help.wardenprotocol.org).

If you're a developer, you can register your Agent on Warden as a **Community Agent**. The key advantages of publishing on Warden include the following:

- **Discoverability**: Once registered, your Agent is instantly accessible to our users.
- **Monetization**: Community Agents support built-in monetization models.
- **Reach**: Access a growing audience of millions.

:::note
To view the list of currently available Warden Agents, log in to [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org/auth) and open the Agent Hub, or explore [Warden documentation](https://help.wardenprotocol.org/warden-app/explore-ai-agents).
