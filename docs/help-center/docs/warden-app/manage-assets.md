## Deposit assets

To start transacting on a chain, fund your wallet with its native coin—for example, **SOL** on **Solana**. Then you can receive other tokens available on the network.

To deposit an asset to your wallet, take the following steps:

1. Log in: 👉 [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org)
2. Click the wallet icon in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Deposit**.
4. Select one of the [supported networks](#supported-networks).
5. Select one of these options:
   - **Pay with card**: Pay through MoonPay.
   - **Transfer from wallet**: Link a Web3 wallet and deposit funds from it. 
   - **Receive funds**: Copy your wallet address or scan the QR code.

:::tip
To view and unlink your linked wallets, see the [account settings](manage-your-wallet#configure-the-wallet).
