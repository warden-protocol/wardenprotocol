# Manage keys

## Overview

This guide explains how to create and manage your **keys** (wallets). Each key holds its own [assets](manage-assets).

Please note that this feature is available only for [Pro accounts](manage-accounts#create-a-pro-account).

:::note
In the Warden Protocol keys are associated with **Keychains** – custodians that generate and store keys and sign transactions. Learn more: [Glossary: Keychain](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/learn/glossary#keychain).
