# Quick start

## Overview

**WardenConnect** is a mobile application serving as a wallet for managing your assets in different networks and exploring decentralized applications (dApps) on the Warden Protocol.

WardenConnect operates on our testnet, **Chiado**. It allows you to test WardenConnect functionality in a secure environment, without real-world risks.

:::warning
This is a **testnet environment**. It's aimed for testing and can break at any time due to unforeseen circumstances. You should **use only testnet assets** – for example, Sepolia ETH. Otherwise, you might lose your assets.
