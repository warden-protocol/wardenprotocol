## Deposit assets

To start transacting on a chain, fund your wallet with its native coin—for example, **SOL** on **Solana**. Then you can receive other tokens available on the network.

To deposit an asset to your wallet, take the following steps:

1. Log in: 👉 [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org)
2. Click the wallet icon in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Deposit**.
4. Select one of the [supported networks](/#supported-networks).
5. Select one of these options:
   - **Pay with card**: Pay through MoonPay.
   - **Transfer from wallet**: Link a Web3 wallet and deposit funds from it. 
   - **Receive funds**: Copy your wallet address or scan the QR code.

To view and unlink your linked wallets, see the [account settings](manage-your-wallet#configure-the-wallet).

## Send or swap assets

In Warden, you can send or swap assets using simple **chat commands**:

1. Log in: 👉 [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org)
2. Make sure your [wallet is funded](#deposit-assets).
3. In the [chat box](use-the-chat), ask the [Warden AMA Agent](explore-ai-agents#warden-ama-agent) to **send** or **swap** an asset.
4. Provide the required details and confirm the transaction in the chat.
5. The Agent will share the transaction details with you. You can also check your [activity history](#view-the-balance--activity).

Before you start, keep in mind this:

- You can use [any other AI Agent](explore-ai-agents#uniswap-trading-api) if it supports transactions on the preferred chain. 
- When specifying the recipient, you can refer to your [favorite addresses](manage-your-wallet#configure-the-wallet) by name.
- All swaps and transfers incur fees: see the [Fees](fees) section for details.
