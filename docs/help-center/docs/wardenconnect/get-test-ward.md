# Get test WARD

To conduct transactions in WardenConnect, you need **test WARD tokens**.

After you create your account, WardenConnect will automatically fund it with some WARD, as shown in the [Quick start guide](quick-start).

If you wish to get more WARD after that, take these steps:

1. In the bottom menu, tap **Home** to access your dashboard.
2. Find WARD in the list of assets and click **Get WARD** next to it.
3. You'll be redirected to a faucet. Click **Get WARD** and wait for WARD to be sent to your wallet.
