# External modules

## Overview

In this section, you'll find descriptions of external [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) modules used by the Warden Protocol. For more details, follow the provided links to external documentation.

## x/evm

The `x/evm` module is a Cosmos SDK module by **Evmos** that allows for the deployment of smart contracts, interaction with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and the use of EVM tooling.

To learn more, see the following:

- [`x/evm` in Evmos documentation](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/modules/evm)
- [`x/evm` on GitHub](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/tree/v0.22.0/x/evm)
- [Warden docs: Build an app](/build-an-app/introduction)

## x/gmp

The `x/gmp` module is a Cosmos SDK module that enables **Axelar GMP** (General Message Passing): sending and receiving messages on EVM and Cosmos chains.

GMP allows smart contracts on one chain to send messages and data to smart contracts on another chain. This technology can be used for various purposes: token transfers, data sharing, or triggering actions across chains.

To learn more, see the following:

- [Cosmos GMP documentation](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/cosmos-gmp)
- [Axelar GMP SDK on GitHub](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity)
- [Warden docs: Bridging](/learn/bridging)
- [Warden docs: Deploy a cross-chain app](/build-an-app/deploy-smart-contracts-on-warden/deploy-a-cross-chain-app)

## x/oracle

The `x/oracle` module is a Cosmos SDK module by **Skip Protocol** that enables storing prices on-chain in **Skip:Connect** (an oracle service).

To learn more, see the following:

- [Connect documentation](https://docs.skip.build/connect/introduction)
- [`x/oracle` on GitHub](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/tree/main/x/oracle)
- [Warden docs: Oracle services](/learn/oracle-services)

## x/wasm

The `x/wasm` module is a Cosmos SDK module that processes certain messages and uses them to upload, instantiate, and execute smart contracts. It's an integral part of **CosmWasm** – a smart contract platform that can be integrated into any blockchain built on top of the Cosmos SDK.

To learn more, see the following:

- [CosmWasm Contract Semantics](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/smart-contracts/contract-semantics)
- [`x/wasm` on GitHub](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/main/x/wasm)
- [Warden docs: Build an app](/build-an-app/introduction)
