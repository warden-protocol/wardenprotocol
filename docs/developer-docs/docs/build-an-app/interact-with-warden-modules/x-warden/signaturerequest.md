# Signaturerequests

## Overview

In this section you will learn how to query and manage `signaturerequests.` If you would like to get an overview of all functions available for IWarden precompile, you can refer to this.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Query signature requests
- Query signature request by ID
- Create a new signature request
- Fulfil a Key request

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a working environment with Foundry
- Set up your private key and RPC URL for your preferred testnet or local node.

## Create Project

1. Initialize a Project using Foundry. If you don't have Foundry installed, refer to this [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

```bash
forge init warden-space --no-commit
cd warden-space
```

2. Install dependencies and add any required `solidity` libraries or dependencies.

3. Create the contract named `WardenSignatureRequest.sol` in the `src` directory. 

*Note: For sake of simplicity, we will only add snippets of code related to the `signaturerequest` function of IWarden precompile. If you would like to refer to the entire smart contract, you can check it here.*

### Query Signature requests

```solidity
```

### Query Signature request by ID

```solidity
```

### Create a new Signature request

```solidity
```

### Fulfil a Signature request

```solidity
```

## Deploy the contract

1. Set Up Environment Variables Export your private key and RPC URL as environment variables:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545  # Example: Replace with your RPC URL
```

*Note: Use secure key storage solutions like `.env` for storing private keys in production.*

2. Compile the Contract Using Foundry, compile the contract:

```bash
forge build
```

3. Deploy the Contract

Deploy the contract using Foundry's forge create command.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/WardenSignatureRequest.sol:WardenSignatureRequest
```

4. Verify the Deployment To verify the contract is deployed, run the following:

```bash
cast code 0xContractAddress --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

5. Save Contract Address Save the contract address in an environment variable for future use:

```bash
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xContractAddress
```

6. Prepare for Interaction Ensure you have a functional cast tool (Foundry) or equivalent to interact with the deployed contract.

## Interacting with Key requests

Now that the contract is deployed, weâ€™ll proceed to interact with the IWarden functions one by one to demonstrate their usage. This step focuses on creating and querying Key requests.

### Query Signature request

### Query all Signature request by ID

### Create new Signature request

### Fulfil Signature request
