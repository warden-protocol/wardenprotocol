# Introduction

You can interact with [Warden Protocol modules](/learn/warden-protocol-modules/introduction) in your EVM smart contract by calling [Warden precompiles](../precompiles/introduction).

To familiarize yourself with precompiles, take the following steps:

1. Deploy a simple EVM contract by following the [Get started](get-started-with-precompiles) guide.
3. After that, you can expand your contract code as shown in other subsections.
4. For an overview of available functions, refer to the [Precompiles](/category/precompiles) section.

In this table, you can find all the resources you'll need to interact with each precompile:

|  Functions | Code samples | Precompile address |
| ---------- | -------------|------------------- |
| [`x/warden` functions](../precompiles/x-warden) | [Interact with `x/warden`](/category/interact-with-xwarden) | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000900` |
| [`x/act` functions](../precompiles/x-act) | [Interact with `x/warden`](/category/interact-with-xact) | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000901` |

| [`x/async` functions](../precompiles/x-async) | [Interact with `x/async`](interact-with-x-async)                                                                                            | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000903` |
