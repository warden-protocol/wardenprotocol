# Introduction

## Omnichain Applications

**Omnichain Applications** (**OApps**) are a powerful evolution of traditional smart contracts. They allow signing transactions at any chain, while traditional smart contract applications only target users of a single chain.

An example of an OApp is [SpaceWard](/learn/glossary#spaceward) – our application functioning as the front-end interface for Warden.

This section explains how to build the backend and frontend of an OApp. Here you'll also find guides for running a [node](/learn/glossary#warden-protocol-node) and a [Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain) in the test mode.

## Get started

The main part of any Omnichain Application is an **Omnichain Contract**: a smart contract that allows signing transactions and messages at any destination chain. For this reason, OApp development starts with building a custom Omnichain Contract with [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com).

To learn more, check our list of CosmWasm resources in the [Useful links](useful-links) section.
