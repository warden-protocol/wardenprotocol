# Use dApps

WardenConnect allows using **decentralized applications** (**dApps**) across various blockchains. These applications streamline and centralize your decentralized finance activities for simplicity and convenience.

## Connect a dApp

To connect a dApp, do the following:

1. Tap the **Add dApp** button in the bottom menu bar.
2. Allow camera access and scan the QR code of the dApp you wish to add.
3. Approve the connection. If you have a [Pro account](manage-accounts#create-a-pro-account), select a [key](manage-keys) for approval or create a new one.

You can access connected dApps from any screen. Just navigate to your dashboard by tapping the **Home** button in the bottom menu bar.

## Disconnect a dApp

To disconnect a dApp, do this:

1. Navigate to your profile by tapping **Profile** in the bottom menu.
2. Tap **Revoke** next to the dApp you wish to disconnect.
