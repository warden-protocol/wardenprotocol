## Overview

[$WARD](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/ward/introduction), the token powering our Agentic economy, is now live and available for trading. 

Registration for the **$WARD airdrop** has ended. Registered users who are eligible can either [claim their $WARD](#claim-ward-on-warden) or receive it [automatically](#receive-ward-automatically). To find out whether you need to claim your reward or not, see [Eligibility & distribution](#eligibility--distribution).

Your airdrop will be available on [Warden Protocol](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/learn/introduction-to-warden).

:::important Important notes
- All registration happened in [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org), and claiming is available on the [Airdrop Claim Portal](https://airdrop.wardenprotocol.org). We'll **never** ask you to connect your wallet to any third-party website.
- To claim $WARD, you must have an active [Warden account](manage-your-wallets#main-account).
- Users who are not registered cannot participate in the claiming phase.
- Registration did not guarantee rewards. Only [eligible users](#eligibility--distribution) can claim $WARD.

## Claim $WARD on Warden

To find out whether you need to claim your reward or not, see [Eligibility & distribution](#eligibility--distribution). This is how **claim-based distribution** works:

- You can choose when to claim. This is a one-time opportunity.
- The longer you wait, the larger your claim amount is.
- You'll reach the maximum allocation **after 6 months**.
- Claiming later also increases your Allocation Power, giving you priority access to future airdrops and priority positioning on the upcoming Agent Launchpad.

You can claim your $WARD in the **Airdrop Claim Portal**:

:::important
Before you proceed, make sure you understand how claim-based distribution works. You may choose to claim later and earn more.

1. In [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org), click the **Airdrop** icon at the top-right. You'll be redirected to the portal. Alternatively, you can access it directly: 👉 [https://airdrop.wardenprotocol.org](https://airdrop.wardenprotocol.org)
2. Click **Claim Rewards**.
3. Connect your [Warden account](manage-your-wallets#main-account). Use the same credentials with which you log in to Warden.
4. Click **Continue**. This option is displayed only if you're eligible.
5. Click **Claim** and confirm.
6. Review and accept the terms.
7. Wait for the claim. Once complete, you'll see a success message.

Once you claim your $WARD, the following happens:
- Your reward is locked.
- Any unclaimed remainder is returned to the Public Goods pool, fueling future community campaigns and rewards.
- You can [stake your $WARD](stake-ward).

## Other ways to get $WARD

External wallets can interact with third-party apps for actions such as **swapping and bridging $WARD**.
