# Introduction

## The Warden Agent Kit

The **Warden Agent Kit** empowers **AI Agents** with the capability to seamlessly access both offchain and onchain functionalities. With our [Quick start](quick-start) guide, you can have an AI Agent up and running in under 5 minutes!

Built on Warden Protocol, this toolkit enables Agents to autonomously execute onchain interactions, such as creating [Spaces](/learn/glossary#space), generating [keys](/learn/glossary#key), facilitating transfers, and managing [Orders](/learn/glossary#order) with support for arbitrary contract invocations.

## Key features

The Warden Agent Kit provides the following key features:

- Framework-agnostic design that seamlessly integrates with any AI Agent framework, ensuring flexibility and adaptability
- Native integration with Warden Protocol for autonomous [onchain operations](agent-actions), such as smart contract interactions, transaction execution, and Order management
- Compatibility with [LangChain](add-agent-capabilities#incorporate-langchain-tools) and support for existing LangChain tools, enabling developers to leverage a rich ecosystem of AI and blockchain integrations
- Customizable templates for extending and [adding new functionalities](add-agent-capabilities#add-a-custom-tool) tailored to specific use cases

## Examples

You can quickly familiarize yourself with the Warden Agent Kit's capabilities by exploring and modifying the available examples:

- [The CLI Agent example](/build-an-agent/warden-agent-kit/cli-agent-example)  
  This example demonstrates how to build and deploy a basic Agent using the Warden Agent Kit. It includes all the essential steps, from setting up your environment to executing onchain interactions.
- [The Agent Kit examples repository](https://github.com/warden-protocol/agent-kit-examples)  
  This is a community-driven resource filled with practical examples, templates, and use cases to inspire and accelerate your development. You can add your own examples to this repository as well.
