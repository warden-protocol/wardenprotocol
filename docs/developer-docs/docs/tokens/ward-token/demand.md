# Demand

## Demand drivers

Warden Protocol aims to drive a sustainable equilibrium between supply and demand of WARD. To drive demand of WARD, there will be a number of intrinsic demand drivers built into the protocol: 

- **Transaction fees**: All fees generated are distributed across WARD validators and their stakers.
- **Operator bonds**: Operators of services must bond WARD, reducing the circulating supply of WARD and enhancing the protocol’s collective security and stability.
- **Governance**: WARD will be used for community governance initiatives, creating a last need for a meaningful stake in Warden.

## Keychain operators

Keychain operators serve a vital role within Warden Protocol.

A Keychain is an offchain service that provides key management services to Warden users. The selected Keychain creates and stores a key material locally and publishes the public key on Warden. Users can then request signatures for various purposes. 

Keychains are required to pay a WARD bond to Warden Protocol by the Total Value Secured concept. This WARD bond is locked and can only be unbonded after a 6 month notice period.

## Validator bonds

To operate a validator on Warden Protocol, validators will be required to stake WARD.
