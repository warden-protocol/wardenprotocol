# Glossary

## Abstract syntax tree

An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a formal representation of an [Approval Rule](#approval-rule) definition. This is how it's created:

1. A user defines a new Approval Rule in the [Intent-Specific Language](#intent-specific-language).
2. A tokenizer breaks the Approval Rule into tokens representing the smallest elements of the [Intent-Specific Language](#intent-specific-language).
3. A parser validates the syntactic structure of the definition and represents it as an AST, which is stored onchain.

---

## Action

An Action is an onchain transaction on Warden Protocol or an offchain operation, such as creating a post on the X network. An Action is executed after an [Approval](#approval) is granted based on a user-defined [Approval Rule](#approval-rule), as specified in an [Intent](#intent).

Here are some examples of onchain Actions:

- A smart contract invocation, such as swapping ETH for MATIC on UniSwap
- A [key request](#key-request) or a [signature request](#signature-request)
- Adding a member to a [Space](#space) in [SpaceWard](#spaceward)

---

## AI Agent

A Warden AI Agent is an AI-driven program that supports both offchain and onchain operations.

Thanks to their native integration with Warden Protocol, Warden Agents can perform onchain [Actions](#action), such as creating [Spaces](#space), generating [keys](#key), executing transactions, and managing [Orders](#order). You can easily build Warden Agents with the [Warden Agent Kit](#warden-agent-kit). AI integration is ensured by Warden's [AI Blockchain Interface](#ai-blockchain-interface-aibi).

Learn more: [Warden AI Agents](warden-ai-agents), [Build an Agent](/build-an-agent/introduction)  

---

## AI Blockchain Interface (AIBI)

Artificial Intelligence Blockchain Interface (AIBI) brings AI onchain with an intuitive interface for developers to integrate AI into their applications and create [AI Agents](#ai-agent). AIBI allows inference endpoints to create cryptographic proofs that verify that an AI model produced a specific prediction. These proofs are then verified on Wardens’ blockchain through a new consensus mechanism.

The core components of AIBI include the following:

- [Orders](#order): EVM [smart contracts](#omnichain-contract) performing onchain actions at any destination chain
- `x/async`: a [Warden module](#module) implementing [Futures](#future) and [Prophets](#prophet)

Learn more: [Warden AI Agents](warden-ai-agents), [Build an onchain AI Agent](/build-an-agent/build-an-onchain-ai-agent/introduction), [`x/async`](warden-protocol-modules/x-async)

---

## Approval

An Approval is a permission for an [Action](#action) to be performed. Approvals are granted according to user-defined [Approval Rules](#approval-rule).

---

## Approval Rule

An Approval Rule is a set of user-defined conditions under which an [Action](#action) is performed. For example, a Rule can allow executing a transaction only if 2 of 3 approvers sign it.

You can define Approval Rules as part of [Intents](#intent), using the [Intent-Specific Language](#intent-specific-language). Warden's [Intent Engine](#intent-engine) ensures the validity of transactions by checking Rules, represented as [abstract syntax trees](#abstract-syntax-tree).

---

## Bonded validator

A bonded validator is an active validator  participating in consensus ([staking](#staking)). Bonded validators validate transactions, propose blocks, and earn rewards for their contributions to the network.

See also: [Unbonding validator](#unbonding-validator), [Unbonded validator](#unbonded-validator).

---

## Bridging

Bridging is a method allowing users to transfer assets across different blockchain networks. This technology utilizes cross-chain bridges—smart contracts that receive and lock tokens on the source chain and then mint a corresponding number of wrapped tokens on the destination chain. Warden currently supports bridging through Axelar.

Learn more: [Bridging](bridging)

---

## Builder incentive

Warden Protocol is open to third-party contributions: core protocol development or building [Omnichain Applications](#omnichain-application) in the Warden ecosystem. We'll reward both types of contributions with builder incentives in [WARD](#ward-token). More details will be announced soon.

---

## Delegator

A delegator is an individual or entity that participates in the [staking](#staking) process by delegating their [WARD tokens](#ward-token) to a [validator](#validator). Delegation allows securing the network and sharing rewards with validators without the responsibility of running a [node](#node).

All delegators inherit the state from their validator: [bonded](#bonded-validator), [unbonding](#unbonding-validator), or [unbonded](#unbonded-validator). To avoid risks, delegators should perform due diligence on validators and spread their stake over multiple validators. Delegators can also participate in [governance](#governance).

---

## Full node

A full node is a server running a software (binary) that maintains a complete up-to-date version of a protocol with full transaction history. You can run a full [Warden Protocol node](#node) yourself.

---

## Future

A Future is an offchain user-defined computational task that is executed asynchronously. The result is stored onchain.

A user requests a Future, specifying an input and a handler for interpreting the input. After that, a [validator](#validator) running a [Prophet](#prophet) executes the Future and provides the result. Other validators vote on correctness of the result. It doesn't slow the blockchain down thanks to asynchronous execution.

---

## Governance

Warden Protocol supports onchain governance. It's a mechanism allowing the decentralized community to update the protocol through direct voting that is recorded onchain. Voting is available for the participants of [staking](#staking): [validators](#validator) and [delegators](#delegator).

The voting power depends on the [validator's weight](#validators-weight) or the amount of [WARD](#ward-token) a delegator staked. By default, [delegators](#delegator) inherit votes of their validator. Alternatively, a delegator can cast their own vote, which will reduce the validator's voting power.

---

## Intent

An Intent is a user-defined script specifying the following:

- An [Action](#action)—any onchain action on Warden Protocol
- An [Approval Rule](#approval-rule)—a set of conditions under which the Action is performed

After an Action is initiated, the [Intent Engine](#intent-engine) checks the Approval Rule. If the conditions are met, an [Approval](#approval) is granted, and the Action is carried out.

---

## Intent Engine

The Intent Engine is an immutable onchain interpreter of the [Intent-Specific Language](#intent-specific-language), acting as a gatekeeper. When a user initiates a transaction ([Action](#action)), the Intent Engine checks the user's [Approval Rule](#approval-rule), represented as an [abstract syntax tree](#abstract-syntax-tree), and returns `true` or `false`—granting or not granting an [Approval](#approval).

---

## Intent-Specific Language

The Intent-Specific Language (ISL) is a language that allows users to configure [Approval Rules](#approval-rule) (as part of [Intents](#intent)). It's composable, extensive, declarative, human-readable, and English-like. The ISL is interpreted by the [Intent Engine](#intent-engine).

---

## Key

Keys in blockchain are paired to identify users and secure the ownership of wallets:

- **Public key**: A public wallet address
- **Private key**: A private code for signing transactions on the wallet

Warden offers [Modular Key Management](#modular-key-management): you can use [Keychains](#keychain) to generate key pairs and sign transactions. This is how it works: [Key request](#key-request), [Signature request](#signature-request).

---

## Key request

A key request is a request asking a [Keychain](#keychain) to generate a pair of private and public [keys](#key). Keychain operators can charge [key request fees](#key-request-fee) for doing it. This is how such requests are processed:

1. A user sends a key request with a [Keychain ID](#keychain-id) identifying the preferred Keychain.
2. The [Intent Engine](#intent-engine) checks the user's [Approval Rule](#approval-rule), specified in an [Intent](#intent).
3. If the Approval Rule is met, the Keychain generates a key pair and stores the private key. A [Keychain Writer](#keychain-writer) publishes the public key to Warden Protocol.

Learn more: [Key request flow](/learn/request-flow#key-request-flow)

---

## Key request fee

[Keychain](#keychain) operators can set fees in [WARD](#ward-token) for [key requests](#key-request). The Keychain collects fees to its [ID](#keychain-id), and then the Keychain operator can manage these funds. Key request fees are indicated in aWARD (0.000000000000000001 WARD).

---

## Keychain

Every [Omnichain Application](#omnichain-application) has at least one Keychain—a custodian that generates and stores [keys](#key) and signs transactions. Keychains contribute to Warden's [Modular Key Management](#modular-key-management) and [Modular security](#modular-security).

Warden Protocol allows users or external organizations to become Keychain operators. They can onboard their own Keychains and charge fees for [key requests](#key-request) and [signature requests](#signature-request). Note that Keychain operators typically use MPC networks to generate keys and signatures.

Learn more: [Build a Keychain](/build-a-keychain/introduction)

---

## Keychain ID

Keychain ID identifies a [Keychain](#keychain) in [key requests](#key-request) and [signature requests](#signature-request) and collects fees from users.

---

## Keychain Writer

A Keychain Writer is an account that publishes signatures and public keys on behalf of a [Keychain](#keychain). It happens when the Keychain responds to a [key request](#key-request) or a [signature request](#signature-request). The Keychain operator can create multiple Writers, each with its own address.

---

## Keychain SDK

The Keychain SDK is a Go SDK that abstracts the communication with [Warden Protocol nodes](#node), facilitating the development of [Keychains](#keychain).

Learn more: [Keychain SDK](/build-a-keychain/implementations/keychain-sdk)

---

## Modular Key Management

Modular Key Management is a flexible approach to managing keys in Warden. Instead of relying on a single provider for key management, users can manage different [keys](#key) with different [Keychains](#keychain). It reduces the risk of single points of failure and gives users greater control over their keys.

---

## Modular Security

Thanks to modularity, the same [Omnichain Application](#omnichain-application) can combine different security models:

- OApp users can set and manage their own application security settings with the help of [Approval Rules](#approval-rule) and [Keychains](#keychain).
- Each OApp is collectively secured by all the tokens [staked](#staking) on the protocol.

By decoupling application-layer and protocol-layer security, Warden takes the best from monolithic and isolated security systems and reducing the risks of both.

---

## Module

Warden protocol modules are [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) modules containing most of Warden Protocol's logic. Users can interact with modules by sending transactions or querying [nodes](/learn/glossary#node). We also provide [precompiles](#precompile) that allow [Omnichain Application](#omnichain-application) builders to call certain modules in EVM smart contracts.

Learn more: [Warden Protocol modules](warden-protocol-modules/introduction)

---

## Node

A Warden Protocol node is a server running the software (binary) of Warden Protocol. To run a blockchain node in Warden, build and run the chain binary called `wardend`. To interact with a node, use the [Node API](/operate-a-node/node-api-reference).

Reasons for running a node include the following:

- Accessing archive data
- Providing services: RPC, GRPC, API, etc.
- Becoming a [validator](#validator)

---

## Omnichain Application

An Omnichain Application (OApp) in an application that builds upon an [Omnichain Contract](#omnichain-contract). OApps allow signing transactions at any chain, while traditional smart contract applications only target users of a single chain. An example of an OApp is [SpaceWard](#spaceward)—our application functioning as the front-end interface for Warden.

Learn more: [Build an app](/build-an-app/introduction)

---

## Omnichain Contract

An Omnichain Contract is the main part of any [Omnichain Application](#omnichain-application): a smart contract that allows signing transactions and messages at any destination chain.

In EVM smart contracts, application builders can call [Warden precompiles](#precompile) to interact with [Warden protocol modules](#module), accessing all core features of Warden Protocol. For advanced usage of EVM contracts with AI Agents, refer to [AI Blockchain Interface](#ai-blockchain-interface-aibi) and [Order](#order).

Learn more: [Build an app](/build-an-app/introduction)

---

## Oracle service

An oracle is a third-party service that enables smart contracts to access real-life data feeds: prices, stock market data, weather conditions, etc. Warden is integrated with [Skip:Connect](https://docs.skip.build/connect/introduction)—an oracle service provided by Skip Protocol and offering mostly price data. Connect's data is [validated](#validator) by Warden's network and written onchain.

Learn more: [Oracle services](oracle-services)

---

## Order

An Order is a Solidity [smart contract](#omnichain-contract) performing onchain actions at any destination chain. It's part of Warden's [AI Blockchain Interface](#ai-blockchain-interface-aibi).

When creating an Order, you can implement custom logic by using [Warden modules](#module), [Keychains](#keychain), and other features. In particular, the `x/async` module allows you to create smart contracts utilizing outputs of AI models. Orders can send any transactions to any Ethereum-based and EVM L2 application.

Learn more: [Build an onchain AI Agent](/build-an-agent/build-an-onchain-ai-agent/introduction), [`x/async`](warden-protocol-modules/x-async)

---

## Precompile

Warden precompiles are precompiled smart contracts that you can call in your EVM smart contract to interact with [Warden Protocol modules](#module). This allows [Omnichain Application](#omnichain-application) builders to manage [Spaces](/learn/glossary#space), [Keychains](/learn/glossary#keychain), [Actions](/learn/glossary#action), [Rules](/learn/glossary#approval-rule), [Futures](/learn/glossary#future), and other components.

Learn more: [Interact with Warden modules](/build-an-app/interact-with-warden-modules/introduction)

---

## Prophet

A Prophet is a sidecar process running on [validator](#validator) nodes, which has two responsibilities:

- Fetching [Future](#future) requests and executing handlers associated with Futures
- Fetching requests satisfied by other validators to vote on the results

Prophets run on validator nodes separately from the [wardend process](#node), without blocking the consensus. Running a Prophet is optional for a validator.

---

## Signature request

A signature request is a request asking a [Keychain](#keychain) to sign a transaction with a private [key](#key). Keychain operators can charge [signature request fees](#signature-request-fee) for doing it. This is how such requests are processed:

1. A user sends a signature request with a [Keychain ID](#keychain-id) identifying the preferred Keychain.
2. The [Intent Engine](#intent-engine) checks the user's [Approval Rule](#approval-rule), specified in an [Intent](#intent).
3. If the Approval Rule is met, a [Keychain Writer](#keychain-writer) publishes a signature to Warden Protocol.

Learn more: [Signature request flow](/learn/request-flow#signature-request-flow)

---

## Signature request fee

[Keychain](#keychain) operators can set fees in [WARD](#ward-token) for [signature requests](#signature-request). The Keychain collects fees to its [ID](#keychain-id), and then the Keychain operator can manage these funds. Signature request fees are indicated in aWARD (0.000000000000000001 WARD).

---

## Space

A Space is a hub allowing its owner (or multiple owners) to manage [keys](#key). Spaces aggregate accounts for different blockchains and provide access to [Omnichain Applications](#omnichain-application).

---

## SpaceWard

SpaceWard is an [Omnichain Application](#omnichain-application) functioning as the front-end interface for Warden. It provides a user-friendly platform where you can create [Spaces](#space), manage wallets and [Intents](#intent), and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and other components of the Web3 ecosystem.

Learn more: [SpaceWard documentation](https://help.wardenprotocol.org)

---

## Staking

Staking is the process of participating in the proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism. [Validators](#validator) and [delegators](#delegator) stake their [WARD tokens](#ward-token) for a chance to validate blocks and transactions and earn staking rewards.

The consensus mechanism chooses validators based on their [weight](#validators-weight). If a validator is successful, its delegators will earn rewards too. If a validator is slashed, the delegator’s stake will be slashed. Staking also allows validators and delegators to participate in [governance](#governance).

---

## Validator

A validator is an individual or entity that participates in the [staking](#staking) process by running a [full](#full-node) or pruned [Warden Protocol node](#node) and validating blocks and transactions. 

Validators act on behalf of their [delegators](#delegator) and earn [commissions](#validators-commission). Each validator has a certain [weight](#validators-weight) and state: [bonded](#bonded-validator), [unbonding](#unbonding-validator), or [unbonded](#unbonded-validator). Validators can also participate in [governance](#governance) and hadling [Futures](#future).

---

## Validator's commission

A validator’s commission is the percentage of [staking](#staking) rewards earned by a validator's pool that the validator retains. The rest is distributed to [delegators](#delegator). Validators can configure their own commissions, but only once, when initially declaring candidacy. The following parameters are available:

- An initial commission
- A maximum daily commission change rate
- A maximum commission

---


## Validator's weight

Each [validator](#validator) has its own [WARD tokens](#ward-token) and tokens bonded by its [delegators](#delegator). The total amount of tokens determines the validator's weight.

The consensus mechanism selects validators to propose blocks based on validators' weight, so a validator with more tokens bonded can propose blocks more frequently and generate more rewards. Weight also determines the validator's voting power in [governance](#governance).

---

## Unbonded validator

An unbonded validator is an inactive validator that isn't signing blocks. Unbonded validators can't be slashed and can’t earn rewards.

See also: [Bonded validator](#bonded-validator), [Unbonding validator](#unbonding-validator).

---

## Unbonding validator

An unbonding validator is a validator that is transitioning from [bonded](#bonded-validator) to [unbonded](#unbonded-validator).

Validators enter this state either when they decide to stop participating in [staking](#staking) or when they're slashed for misbehavior. During the unbonding period, validators aren't participating in the consensus process and aren't earning rewards.

---

## WARD token

WARD is the native utility token integral to the Warden Protocol ecosystem. It facilitates various operations such as [governance](#governance), [staking](#staking), protocol fees and acts as a medium of payment for operators, such as [Keychain](#keychain) operators.

Learn more: [WARD token](/tokens/ward-token/ward)

---

## Warden Agent Kit

The Warden Agent Kit allows creating [AI Agents](#ai-agent) that are able to access both offchain and onchain functionalities. The kit offers native integration with Warden Protocol for onchain [Actions](#action) and supports compatibility with Typescript, any AI Agent framework, and [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) tools.

Learn more: [Warden Agent Kit](/build-an-agent/warden-agent-kit/introduction)

---

## WARP token

WARP is a dynamic counterpart to [WARD](#ward-token), adding liquidity and gamification to the Warden Protocol ecosystem. It fuels engagement and participation through innovative tokenomics.
