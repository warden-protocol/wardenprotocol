### WachAI

**WachAI** is an Agent that performs token verification. It uses the following methods:

- **Address- and chain-based verification**: You provide WachAI with the token's address and the blockchain it resides on.This method is highly accurate, as token addresses are unique.
- **Ticker-based verification**: You provide WachAI with a token's ticker, and the Agent fetches verification data. This method is less reliable due to possible duplicates in token tickers.

Fees: [informational Agent fees](fees#informational-agent-fees).
