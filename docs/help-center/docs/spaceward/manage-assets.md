# Manage assets

## Overview

Within your [Space](manage-spaces), you can receive or send assets across different chains. Assets are associated with your [keys](manage-keys) (wallets).

:::warning
SpaceWard currently operates on the **Buenavista testnet**, so you should use **only testnet assets** – for example, Sepolia ETH. Otherwise, you might lose your assets.
