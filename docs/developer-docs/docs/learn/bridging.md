# Bridging

:::tip
This feature is actively being developed and is currently undergoing changes.
:::

## Overview

**Bridging** is a method allowing users to transfer assets across different blockchain networks.

This technology utilizes **crosschain bridges**—smart contracts that receive and lock tokens on the source chain and then mint a corresponding number of **wrapped tokens** on the destination chain.

## Axelar

Thanks to Warden's [x/gmp](warden-protocol-modules/external-modules#xgmp) module, [Intelligent Applications](glossary#intelligent-application) support crosschain token transfers and general message passing through **Axelar**.

More integrations are coming soon.

## Available chains

Currently Axelar provides [65 connected chains](https://axelarscan.io). This number may change over the course of time as more chains are added.

You can perform transactions on Ethereum, other IBC-enabled chains, and any ECDSA- or EDDSA-based chain supported by the [Keychain](glossary#keychain) you're using—for example, Bitcoin.
