# Use the AI chat

## Overview

The **AI-powered chat** is the main way to interact with Warden.

Use simple commands to send and swap your assets, check your balance, or ask questions about the app, Warden Protocol, and the crypto market.

You can start chatting with the default **Warden Agent** or select another [AI Agent](explore-ai-agents), as described in the sections below.

## Access the chat

When you log in to [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org), a new conversation with the AI-powered [Warden Agent](explore-ai-agents#warden-agent) opens automatically.

You can access Agent chats anytime by navigating to the **Chats** tab in the left menu:

## Start chatting

To start interacting, just type your request in the chat box.

For example, to perform a transaction, [fund your wallet](manage-your-wallets#deposit) and ask the Warden Agent to [send or swap an asset](manage-your-wallets#send-or-swap).

:::note
Transactions are subject to [transfer](fees#transfer-fee) and [swap fees](fees#swap-fees).

## Select an AI Agent

In addition to the Warden Agent, you can interact with [other AI Agents](explore-ai-agents#uniswap-trading-api) available in the app.

Explore Agents in the [Agent Hub](explore-ai-agents#access-agents) or switch between them directly in the **Chats** tab using the drop-down menu at the top:
