Warden Protocol is powered by **$WARD**, its native utility token.

$WARD is designed to facilitate various operations on [Warden Chain](/learn/glossary#warden-chain)—such as governance, staking, protocol fees—and to serve as a medium of payment for operators. For [Warden](/learn/glossary#warden), it'll act as a gas abstraction token and unlock gated functionality.
