# Introduction

## The `pricepred` AVR Plugin

You can request decentralized **price predictions** for different cryptocurrencies from your smart contract, receive responses asynchronously, and process the data within the contract.

To achieve this, call the [`x/async` precompile](../../precompiles/x-async) and use the `pricepred` [AVR Plugin](/learn/warden-protocol-modules/x-async#avr-plugins).

Tutorials in this section explain how to implement different price prediction requests and process their results.

## Use cases

Potential use cases for the `pricepred` Plugin include the following:

- DeFi protocols requiring future price estimates
- Risk management systems
- Trading strategy backtesting
- DAO governance forecasting

## Get started

To get started, [set up your environment](set-up-the-environment).
