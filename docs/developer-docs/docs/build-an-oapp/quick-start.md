# Quick start

*This section is under construction.*

*To get started, you can check our list of CosmWasm resources in the [Useful links](useful-links) section.*

<!---
- A guide explaining how to start building using an npx command for creating a smart contract (once we have it)
- Set up the environment
- Create dependencies
- Use the npx command
- Result: an empty contract

**Note 1:** This guide shows how to create an empty smart contract. The following guides will show how to implement the logic of the contract.

**Note 2:** We could also try publishing something like this [Injective example](https://docs.injective.network/develop/guides/cosmwasm-dapps/Your_first_contract_on_injective/) (building a simple counter website).
