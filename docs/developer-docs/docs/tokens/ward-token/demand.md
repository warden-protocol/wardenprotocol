# Demand

## Demand drivers

Warden Protocol aims to drive a sustainable equilibrium between supply and demand of $WARD. To drive demand of $WARD, there will be a number of intrinsic demand drivers built into the protocol: 

- **Transaction fees**: $WARD will be the primary gas/fee abstraction token in the ecosystem, for both the Protocol and the Warden App.
- **Operator bonds**: Operators of certain services must bond $WARD, reducing the circulating supply of $WARD and enhancing the protocol’s collective security and stability.
- **Governance**: $WARD will be used for community governance initiatives, creating a lasting need for a meaningful stake in Warden.

## Keychain operators

[Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain) operators serve a vital role within Warden Protocol.

A Keychain is an offchain service that provides key management services to Warden users. The selected Keychain creates and stores a key material locally and publishes the public key on Warden. Users can then request signatures for various purposes. 

Keychains are required to pay a $WARD bond to Warden Protocol by the Total Value Secured concept. This $WARD bond is locked and can only be unbonded after a 6-month notice period.

## Validator bonds

To operate a validator on Warden Protocol, validators will be required to hold a meaningful stake of $WARD.
