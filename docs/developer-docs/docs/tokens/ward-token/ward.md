# $WARD

**$WARD** is the native utility token for the Warden ecosystem, sitting at the heart of both the Warden Protocol and the [Warden App](/learn/glossary#warden-app).

$WARD is designed to facilitate various operations—such as governance, staking, rewards—and to serve as a medium of payment for any developer publishing an [Agent](/learn/glossary#ai-agent) on Warden. For the [Warden App](/learn/glossary#warden-app), it'll act as a gas abstraction token and unlock gated functionality, including future subscription tiers.
