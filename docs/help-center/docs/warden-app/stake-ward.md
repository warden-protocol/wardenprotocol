# Stake $WARD

## Overview

[$WARD](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/ward/introduction) is the native token of Warden Protocol.

If you hold $WARD, you can **stake** it to participate in the network's security and earn **rewards**. The more you stake, the more rewards you receive!

This section explains how to stake $WARD, claim rewards, stake more, or unstake.

:::note
When staking, you **delegate** your tokens to a preferred **validator** acting on your behalf. To learn more, see [Warden validators](#warden-validators).
:::

1. Log in: 👉 [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org).
2. Click the wallet icon at the top right to open your [main account](manage-your-wallets#main-account).
3. Click **Stake** next to you $WARD balance.

1. On the staking screen, click **Stake**.
2. Select a validator. You can sort and filter the list.
3. Enter the amount to stake.

## Earn & claim

**Staking rewards** are distributed automatically by the network. They accrue **over time** based on the following:

- The amount you've staked
- How your [validator](#warden-validators) performs

You can **claim** any portion of your accumulated rewards at any time:

1. On the [staking screen](#access-staking), click **Claim**.
2. Enter the amount.
3. Confirm the transaction.

You'll immediately receive $WARD to your main account.

You can **unstake** any portion of your staked $WARD at any time:

1. On the [staking screen](#access-staking), click **Unstake**.
2. Select the validator you want to unstake from.
3. Enter the amount to unstake.
4. Confirm.

There is an **unbonding period of 14 days** during which your tokens will be locked before they become available in your wallet again.

## Warden validators

**Validators** are nodes that participate in the consensus process to secure the Warden Protocol network. They validate transactions and produce new blocks. By staking, you **delegate** your $WARD to a validator and earn a share of the rewards.

:::tip
When selecting validators on Warden, you can sort them by the following parameters: **total staked**, **voting power**, and **commission**. Learn more: [How to choose a validator?](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/operate-a-node/delegation-plan#how-to-choose-a-validator)
