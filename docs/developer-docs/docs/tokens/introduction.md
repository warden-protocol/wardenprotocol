# Introduction

Warden Protocol is powered by **$WARD**, its native utility token.

$WARD is designed to facilitate various operations—such as governance, staking, protocol fees—and to serve as a medium of payment for operators. For the [Warden App](/learn/glossary#warden-app), it'll act as a gas abstraction token and unlock gated functionality.
