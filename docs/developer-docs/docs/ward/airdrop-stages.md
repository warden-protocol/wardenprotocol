# Airdrop stages

## Stage 1

The first snapshot for a portion of the airdrop of $WARD has been completed for participants on Warden testnets, WARP holders, and users from other ecosystems. This is merely the initial step among various potential methods to gain access to the $WARD airdrop.

**Subsequent stages** will also encompass participants in our final testnet, **Docas**, and users of [Warden](/learn/glossary#warden).

## Stage 2 

If you are reading this, it has begun. Hint: [Warden](/learn/glossary#warden).

Our guiding principle will be rewarding builders and real users.

Sybil farmers beware. You'll be eliminated.
