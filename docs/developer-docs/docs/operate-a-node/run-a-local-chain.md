# Run a local chain

## Overview

This guide explains how to run a local chain for development and testing purposes. To interact with the chain, you'll use [node commands](/operate-a-node/node-commands).

There are two ways to run a node:

- **Option 1: Run a `just` script**  
It's the simplest way to run a local chain. Initiate our `just` script that builds the chain binary and then creates, configures, and runs a new chain.

- **Option 2. Configure manually**  
We recommend this option if you wish to run a node with custom settings and learn the basics of interacting with a node.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, complete the following prerequisites:

- [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.22.3 or later.
- [Install just](https://github.com/casey/just) 1.34.0 or later.

:::tip
You can install `just` it using `brew`:
   
```bash
brew install just
```
:::

## Option 1. Run a `just` script

The simplest way to run a local chain is initiating our `just` script that builds the chain binary and then creates, configures, and runs a new chain.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the Warden Protocol repository and navigate to the root directory:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol
cd wardenprotocol
```

### 2. Execute the script

Then execute the `just` script:
   
```bash
just localnet
```

You'll see blocks being produced and height incrementing.

:::note
You can check the settings of your node in the genesis file: `$HOME/.warden/config/genesis.json`. There you'll find two validator addresses, a Keychain, a Space, and other settings. See `accounts`, `keychains`, `spaces`, etc.
:::

## Option 2. Configure manually

We recommend this option if you wish to run a node with custom settings and learn the basics of interacting with a node.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the Warden Protocol repository and navigate to the root directory:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol
cd wardenprotocol
```

### 2. Build the binary

1. Then use `just` to build the chain binary called `wardend`:
      
   ```bash
   just wardend build
   ```

2. To install the binary in your `$GOPATH`, run this command:

   ```bash
   just wardend install
   ```
3. You can check the binary location and version:
   
   ```bash
   which wardend
   wardend version
   ```

### 3. Create and configure a chain

In this flow, you'll create and configure your chain manually.

1. Initialize a local node. Specify a human-readable name (moniker) and ID for your chain:
   
   ```bash
   wardend init my-chain-moniker --chain-id chain_123-1
   ```

   :::tip
   The correct format for your chain ID is `name_number-number`. You can choose any name and numbers you wish.
   :::

   You can find your new node in the `$HOME/.warden/config` directory. For the genesis file, see `$HOME/.warden/config/genesis.json.`

2. Set the correct denomination in `award` across the genesis file:

   ```
   sed -i 's/stake/award/g' ../.warden/config/genesis.json
   ```

3. Create a key pair, specifying a custom key (validator account) name:

   ```bash
   wardend keys add my-key-name
   ```

   You'll be prompted to create a passphrase, which is required for confirming some of the next steps.

   :::warning
   After you enter the passphrase, the node will return the validator account address and a mnemonic phrase. Note them down: you'll need this data for recovering your account if necessary.
   :::

4. Add a genesis (validator) account. Specify your key name and the number of tokens staked:

   ```bash
   wardend genesis add-genesis-account my-key-name 20000000000000000000000000award
   ```

   This will add your address to the `accounts` section of the genesis file.

5. Generate a genesis transaction. Specify your key name, the amount to stake, and the chain ID:
   
   ```bash
   wardend genesis gentx my-key-name 1000000000000000000000award --chain-id chain_123-1
   ```

6. Collect genesis transactions:
   
   ```bash
   wardend genesis collect-gentxs
   ```

   This will add your transaction to the `gen_txs` section of the genesis file.

7. Validate the genesis file:
   
   ```bash
   wardend genesis validate-genesis
   ```

   You should receive a confirmation that `genesis.json` is a valid genesis file.

8. Set the minimum gas price:

   ```
   wardend config set app minimum-gas-prices 0award
   ```

   This command will update the `minimum-gas-prices` field in `$HOME/.warden/config/app.toml`. For testing purposes, we recommend setting the gas price to 0. Otherwise, you'll have to add a `--fee` flag to all transactions, such as creating a Keychain or a Space.

### 4. Run the chain

Finally, start your node:
   
```bash
wardend start
```

You'll see blocks being produced and height incrementing.

### 5. Add more settings

In the previous steps, you configured your node with the minimum settings required for running it. However, for testing purposes, you may need to enable more features – for example, a Space and a Keychain.

#### Create a Space

1. To create a Space, run the following command. Specify your key name and the chain ID:
   
   ```bash
   wardend tx warden new-space \
     --from my-key-name \
     --chain-id chain_123-1
   ```

2. Enter your passphrase and confirm the transaction.

3. After that, you can query the node to check the result:

   ```bash
   wardend query warden spaces
   ```
   
   The output should look like this:
   
   ```bash
   pagination:
     total: "1"
   spaces:
   - creator: warden1h7akmejqcrafp3mfpjqamghh89kzmkgjzsy3mc
     id: "1"
   owners:
   - warden1h7akmejqcrafp3mfpjqamghh89kzmkgjzsy3mc
   ```

#### Create a Keychain

To create a Keychain and add a Keychain Writer, take steps from this guide: [Create a Keychain](/build-a-keychain/operate-a-keychain/create-a-keychain).


## Result

If the chain is up, you'll see logs every time a new block is produced (approximately every second).

You should also be able to query the chain and access data from the genesis block. For example, you can run the following in a separate terminal window:

```bash
wardend status
```

The output should contain status information about your node:

```json
{
  "node_info": {
    "protocol_version": {
      "p2p": "8",
      "block": "11",

    },
    "voting_power": "1000000"
  }
}
```

If you need to stop the node, use **Ctrl + C**. To start it again from block 0, run `wardend start`.

## Next steps

- Now you can deploy a smart contract on the local chain, as explained in these guides:
  - [Deploy an EVM contract](/build-an-app/deploy-smart-contracts-on-warden/deploy-an-evm-contract)
  - [Deploy a WASM contract](/build-an-app/deploy-smart-contracts-on-warden/deploy-a-wasm-contract)
- You can also create and test a Keychain locally. Start with this guide: [Create a Keychain](/build-a-keychain/operate-a-keychain/create-a-keychain).
- To join our testnet, see [Join Chiado](chiado-testnet/join-chiado).
