Please note that this feature is available only for [Pro accounts](manage-accounts#create-a-pro-account).

## Create your first Space

After you create your Pro account, WardenConnect will automatically create your first Space, as shown in the [Quick start guide](quick-start).

If you wish to create additional Spaces, take these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Space** menu at the top of the screen.
2. Tap **New Space**.
3. Tap **Approve**.

To switch between Spaces, just open the **Space** menu.

## View details of a Space

You can access the dashboard with the overview of your Space from any screen. Just tap the **Home** button in the bottom menu bar.
