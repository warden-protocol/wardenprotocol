# Airdrop stages

## Stage 1

The first snapshot for a portion of the airdrop of $WARD has been completed for early contributors, validators, and testers. This is merely the initial step among various potential methods to gain access to the $WARD airdrop.

**Subsequent stages** will also encompass participants in our final testnet, **Docas**, and users of [Warden](/learn/glossary#warden).

## Stage 2 

If you are reading this, it has begun. Hint: [Warden](/learn/glossary#warden).

Our guiding principle will be rewarding builders and real users.

Sybil farmers beware. You'll be eliminated.
