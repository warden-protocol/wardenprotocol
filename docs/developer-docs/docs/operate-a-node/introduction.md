# Introduction

## Warden Protocol nodes

A Warden node is a server running the [Warden Chain](/learn/glossary#warden-chain) software (binary).

Reasons for running a node include the following:

- Accessing archive data
- Providing services: RPC, GRPC, API, etc.
- Becoming a [validator](/learn/glossary#validator)

## Section overview

- [Delegation plan](delegation-plan)  
  Here you can learn about our delegation plan.

- [Mainnet](mainnet/mainnet-overview)  
  This section covers Warden's Mainnet. To get started, follow [Join Mainnet](mainnet/join-mainnet). Then you can [create a validator](mainnet/create-a-validator).

- [Barra testnet](barra-testnet/barra-overview)  
  This section covers our testnet. To get started, follow [Join Barra](barra-testnet/join-barra). Then you can [create a validator](barra-testnet/create-a-validator).

- [Operate Skip:Connect](operate-skip-connect)    
  After joining a network and creating a validator, you can run the oracle service integrated with Warden.

- [Node API](node-api), [Node commands](node-commands)  
  To interact with the node, use the Node API and node commands.

## Get started

You can get started with operating a node by following the steps in [Join Barra](barra-testnet/join-barra).
