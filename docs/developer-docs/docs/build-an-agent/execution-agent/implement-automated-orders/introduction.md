# Introduction

## Overview

This section explains how to implement **automated Orders** – smart contracts that monitor prices and automatically execute token swaps on Uniswap when user-defined price thresholds are met.

You'll implement the core logic in the [`BasicOrder`](implement-orders) contract, implement the creation of Orders in [`BasicOrderFactory`](implement-the-creation-of-orders), and finally [deploy an Order](deploy-an-order).

To learn more about the architecture and user flow, refer to the [Execution Agent introduction](../introduction).

You can find the full code of the example Warden Agent on [GitHub](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/tree/main/solidity).
