### Tap to pump

- **Tap Cost**: Each tap costs **$0.10** (deducted from user balance).
- **Base Reward**: Each tap grants **10 PUMPs**.
- **Random Boosts**:
    - In every set of 10 taps, the user has a chance to trigger a boost (x10, x15, x20).
    - Boost replaces the base reward for that tap (e.g., instead of 5 PUMPs, user receives 50, 75, or 100 PUMPs).
    - After the first 10 taps, the chance for boosts continues at the same interval logic (every 10 taps).

Charging logic: we are using a strict payment hierarchy with USDC on Sol, Base, Ethereum, and then the native tokens on Solana, Base, Ethereum. If one fails, we try the next one.

Every 10 taps, you have a chance to trigger a boost: x10, x15, or x20.
The boost multiplies your base PUMP rewards per tap.

### Check your rank

To check your coin's rank, navigate to the **Rewards** tab and scroll down to the **PUMP Leaderboard**:
