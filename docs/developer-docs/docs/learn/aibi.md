# AI Blockchain Interface

We're proud to announce the alpha release of **AIBI**—**Artificial Intelligence Blockchain Interface**.

AIBI brings AI onchain with an intuitive interface for developers to integrate AI into their applications. Inspired by proof-of-computation and computational pipelines, AIBI allows inference endpoints to create cryptographic proofs that verify that an AI model produced a specific prediction. These proofs are then verified on Wardens’ blockchain through a new consensus mechanism, ensuring AI outputs are not just delivered, but can be trusted.

Within Warden, AI is integrated on two layers:

- **Verification layer**  
Warden is designed to bring AIs onchain safely. Our verification layer uses blockchain, cryptography, and consensus to verify AI results are correct.

- **Execution layer**  
Easily integrate AI with your application, protocols, and smart contracts. Automate their execution across any chain.
