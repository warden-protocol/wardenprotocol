# Warden AI Agents

## Warden Agents

A **Warden AI Agent** is an AI-driven program that supports both offchain and onchain operations.

Thanks to their native integration with Warden Protocol, Warden Agents can perform onchain [Actions](glossary#action), such as creating [Spaces](glossary#space), generating [keys](glossary#key), executing transactions, and managing [Orders](#orders).

You can easily build Agents with the [Warden Agent Kit](/category/warden-agent-kit).

## AI integration

As explained in the sections below, Warden Agents' integration with AI is based on the following key components (previously called AIBI):

- [Orders](#orders)
- [`x/async`](#xasync)
- [SPEX](#spex)

Warden allows inference endpoints to create cryptographic proofs that verify that an AI model produced a specific output. These proofs are then verified on Wardens’ blockchain through a new consensus mechanism, ensuring AI outputs are not just delivered, but can be trusted.

Within Warden, AI is integrated on two layers:

- **Verification layer**  
Warden is designed to bring AIs onchain safely. Our verification layer uses blockchain, cryptography, and consensus to verify AI results are correct.

- **Execution layer**  
Easily integrate AI with your application, protocols, and smart contracts. Automate their execution across any chain.

## Key components

### Orders

Warden Agents support the creation and management of **Orders**.

An Order is a Solidity [smart contract](glossary#omnichain-contract) performing onchain Actions at any destination chain. When creating an Order, you can implement custom logic by using [Warden modules](glossary#module), [Keychains](glossary#keychain), and other features.

In particular, the `x/async` module allows you to create smart contracts utilizing outputs of AI models. Orders can send any transactions to any Ethereum-based and EVM L2 application.

### `x/async`

The `x/async` module is a [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/) module for running offchain heavyweight computations asynchronously and storing the results onchain. It uses the [ABCI 2.0](https://docs.cometbft.com/v1.0/spec/abci/) framework and its [vote extensions](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/abci/vote-extensions) to implement [Futures](glossary#future) and [Prophets](glossary#prophet).

The `x/async` module decouples transaction processing from consensus and moves away from the traditional wait-and-process model. Developers can initiate various crosschain computations including AI inferences and other tasks as asynchronous intents that are resolved later. This approach prevents smart contracts from blocking operations.

### SPEX

**Statistical Proof of Execution (SPEX)** is a sampling-based verifiable computing protocol that ensures the integrity of computational tasks through probabilistic guarantees. This includes tasks with potentially non-deterministic outputs, such as those involving large language models (LLMs) or stochastic training pipelines.

SPEX is used as a verifiability layer for AI on Warden Protocol. At the moment, SPEX verifies AI-driven price predictions generated by `x/async`. However, you can extend the module with other computational tasks and use SPEX to protect them.
