# Register for the airdrop

## Overview

Registration for the [WARD](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/ward/introduction) airdrop is going live.

You can sign up through the **Airdrop Registration Portal** in Warden. Before registering, you may need to prepare your account—follow this guide to learn more.

:::warning
Make sure that you only access the Airdrop Registration Portal through [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org). Do not click any external or social links.

## Important information

- All registration happens in [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org). We'll **never** ask you to connect your wallet to any third-party website.
- You must have an active [Warden account](manage-your-wallets#the-main-account) to register and claim rewards.
- Linking any external wallet or account must happen **before** the registration.
- Registration does not guarantee rewards. Allocations will be provided at the claiming stage.
- Users who do not register will not be able to participate in the claiming phase.

## 1. Prepare your account

Before registering, make sure your [Warden account](manage-your-wallets#the-main-account) is ready. The steps below depend on your user type.

### Warden users

Your Warden account already contains all the necessary information, and no additional action is required. Just [register](#2-register) on the Airdrop Registration Portal.

### Kaito yappers

Before registering on the Airdrop Registration Portal, link your X account to your Warden account.

1. Log in: 👉 [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org)
2. Click the wallet icon at the top right. This will open your account.
3. Go to **Settings** by clicking the gear icon.
4. In the **Login** section, link your X (Twitter) account to your Warden account.

After this, you can [register for the airdrop](#2-register).
