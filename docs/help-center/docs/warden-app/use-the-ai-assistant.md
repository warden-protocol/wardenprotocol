# Use the AI assistant

Our **AI assistant** is the primary way to interact with the Warden App.

Use simple **chat commands** to send and swap your assets, check your balance, and ask anything about the app, Warden Protocol, or the crypto market.

Once you log in to the [Warden App](https://app.wardenprotocol.org), you'll see a dashboard with a chat box at the bottom. Just type your request in the chat box or select one of the suggested topics from the dashboard:

You can easily manage your conversations with the AI:

- To create more chats, click **New chat** in the top-left corner on the screen.
- To return to a previously created chat, click the chat icon next to **New Chat** and select the conversation you want to revisit.
- To perform a transaction, [fund your wallet](manage-assets#deposit-assets) and ask the assistant to [send or swap an asset](manage-assets#send-or-swap-assets).
