## Important information

- Linking any external wallet or account must happen **before** the registration.
- Registration does not guarantee rewards. Allocations will be provided at the claiming stage.
- Users who do not register will not be able to participate in the claiming phase.
- To eliminate bot accounts, we charge a small randomized **registration fee**.

## 1. Prepare your account

Before registering, make sure your [Warden account](manage-your-wallets#the-main-account) is ready. The steps below depend on your user type.

### Warden users

Your Warden account already contains all the necessary information, and no additional action is required. Just [register](#2-register) on the Airdrop Registration Portal.

### Kaito yappers

1. Log in: 👉 [Warden](https://app.wardenprotocol.org)
