# Handle arrays and nested objects

## Overview

The [`IJson` precompile](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/blob/main/precompiles/json/IJson.sol) allows manipulating JSON data from EVM smart contracts.

This article covers methods that allow handling arrays and nested objects. You'll learn how to call these methods and interact with them after deploying your contract.

To understand how to set up and deploy your project, see [Get started with precompiles](../get-started-with-precompiles).

:::tip
- For an overview of `JSON` functions, refer to [Precompiles: JSON](../../precompiles/json#arrays-and-nested-objects).
- The precompile address is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000904`.

## Get a string array

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getStringArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-string-array) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get a boolean array

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getBoolArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-boolean-array) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get an address array

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getAddressArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-an-address-array) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get a uint256 array

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getUintArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-uint256-array) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get an int256 array

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getIntArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-an-int256-array) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get a float array

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getFloatArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-float-array) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get an object array

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getObjectsArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-an-object-array) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get a nested object

To get a string array value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getObject()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-nested-object) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a string array pair

To set a string array key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setStringArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-string-array-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set an address array pair

To set an address array key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setAddressArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-an-address-array-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a boolean array pair

To set a boolean array key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setBoolArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-boolean-array-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a uint256 array pair

To set a uint256 array key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setUintArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-uint256-array-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set an int256 array pair

To set an int256 array key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setIntArray()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-an-int256-array-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```
