# Introduction

## Example Orders

This section explains how to enable on-chain capabilities for a **Warden Agent** created with the [Warden Agent Kit](/category/warden-agent-kit).

The guides you'll find here cover an example we created for demonstration purposes. It implements **Orders** – [Solidity smart contracts](/build-an-app/deploy-smart-contracts-on-warden/deploy-an-evm-contract) performing on-chain actions and utilizing **AI-driven price predictions**.

:::tip
You can implement custom logic by using [Warden modules](/category/warden-protocol-modules), [Keychains](/learn/glossary#keychain), and other features. In particular, the [`x/async` module](/learn/warden-protocol-modules/x-async) allows you to create smart contracts utilizing outputs of **AI models**.

In our example, Orders perform swaps on Uniswap, but you can make them send any transactions to any Ethereum-based and EVM L2 app. For example, your application can transfer ETH or call an arbitrary contract.

## Order types

You'll learn how to build two types of Orders:

- **Automated Orders**: the [`BasicOrder`](implement-automated-orders/implement-orders) contract  

  The basic automated Orders monitor prices and automatically execute token swaps on Uniswap when user-defined price thresholds are met, signing transactions with [Keychains](/learn/glossary#keychain).

- **Automated Orders with price prediction**: the [`AdvancedOrder`](implement-automated-orders-with-price-prediction/implement-orders) contract  

  This is a more advanced version of automated Orders. It uses the [`x/async`](/learn/warden-protocol-modules/x-async) Warden module to make AI-driven price predictions. Then it performs token swaps based on these predictions, signing transactions with [Keychains](/learn/glossary#keychain).

  :::note
  The price prediction model is just an example of what you can build with [`x/async`](/learn/warden-protocol-modules/x-async). With this module, you can implement any logic combining off-chain computation with on-chain verification – limited only by your imagination.

## Architecture

The core logic of Orders in implemented in two smart contracts:

- [`BasicOrder`](implement-automated-orders/implement-orders): A contract implementing [Automated Orders](implement-automated-orders/introduction)
- [`AdvancedOrder`](implement-automated-orders-with-price-prediction/implement-orders): A contract implementing [Automated Orders with price prediction](implement-automated-orders-with-price-prediction/introduction)

Both Order types share [common infrastructure](/category/build-the-infrastructure-for-orders):

  - [Helpers and utils](build-the-infrastructure-for-orders/create-helpers-and-utils), including the [`Registry`](build-the-infrastructure-for-orders/create-helpers-and-utils#3-implement-the-registry) contract for storing the Order and transaction data
  - [Warden](build-the-infrastructure-for-orders/create-mock-precompiles#12-create-a-warden-precompile) & [Slinky](build-the-infrastructure-for-orders/create-mock-precompiles#11-create-a-slinky-precompile): Mock precompiles for signing transactions and fetching prices
  - [`IExecution`](build-the-infrastructure-for-orders/implement-the-execution-interface): A contract implementing the Order execution interface
  - [`OrderFactory`](build-the-infrastructure-for-orders/implement-the-creation-of-orders): A contract facilitating the creation of Orders
