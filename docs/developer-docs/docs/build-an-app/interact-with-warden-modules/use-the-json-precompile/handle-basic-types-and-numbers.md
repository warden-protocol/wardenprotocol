# Handle basic types and numbers

## Overview

The [`IJson` precompile](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/blob/main/precompiles/json/IJson.sol) allows manipulating JSON data from EVM smart contracts.

This article covers methods that allow handling basic value types and numbers. You'll learn how to call these methods and interact with them after deploying your contract.

To understand how to set up and deploy your project, see [Get started with precompiles](../get-started-with-precompiles).

:::tip
- For an overview of `JSON` functions, refer to [Precompiles: JSON](../../precompiles/json#basic-types-and-numbers).
- The precompile address is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000904`.

## Get a string value

To get a string value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getString()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-string-value) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get a boolean value

To get a boolean value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getBool()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-boolean-value) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get an address value

To get an address value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getAddress()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-an-address-value) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get a uint256 value

To get a uint256 value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getUint256()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-uint256-value) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get an int256 value

To get an int256 value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getInt256()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-an-int256-value) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Get a float value

To get a float value by key, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`getFloat()` function](../../precompiles/json#get-a-float-value) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a string pair

To set a string key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setString()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-string-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a boolean pair

To set a boolean key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setBool()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-boolean-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set an address pair

To set an address key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setAddress()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-an-address-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a bytes pair

To set a bytes key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setBytes()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-bytes-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a uint256 pair

To set a uint256 key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setUint256()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-uint256-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set an int256 pair

To set an int256 key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`setInt256()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-an-int256-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `XXX()` function.

```bash
XXX
```

## Set a float pair

To set a float key-value pair, use the following code in your contract. It calls the [`XXX()` function](../../precompiles/json#set-a-float-pair) of the precompile.

```solidity
XXX
```

After deploying your contract, you can interact with it by calling the `setFloat()` function.

```bash
XXX
```
