# Agent Actions

By default, the Warden Agent Kit supports the following Actions:

- `get_spaces`: Retrieve all your spaces.
- `create_space`: Create a new space.
- `get_keys`: Get all keys for a given space.
- `create_key`: Create a new key for a specified space and keychain.
- `get_keychains`: Retrieve all available keychains.
- `get_balance`: Check the balance of Sepolia ETH for a specific key.
- `request_funds`: Request WARD tokens from the faucet.
- `get_price`: Get the current price of a token using its symbol.
- `send_tokens`: Send tokens to another address from your key.
- `create_order`: Create a new order.

As the Warden Agent Kit continues to evolve, more tools and features will be added to enhance its functionality. In the meantime, you can expand your agent's capabilities by integrating existing tools from the LangChain community or developing your own custom tools.
