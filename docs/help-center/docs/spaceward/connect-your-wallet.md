# Connect your wallet

To start using SpaceWard, connect your **Cosmos wallet** to your Warden account.

## Create a wallet

If you don't have a Web3 wallet, create one. You can use any EVM wallet or a wallet supported by [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.network).

## Connect

Now you can connect to SpaceWard:

1. Connect to SpaceWard: 👉 [SpaceWard on Chiado](https://spaceward.chiado.wardenprotocol.org/)
2. Click **Connect**.    
3. Select a wallet to connect.    
4. Your wallet will prompt you to add the Warden Protocol chain.
5. Approve the transaction, and you'll be ready to enter SpaceWard!

## Get your Warden address

After connecting, you'll receive a **Warden address**.

To get it, click your connected wallet icon in the top-right corner of the screen. A pop-up will open where you can see the wallet details and copy the address.
