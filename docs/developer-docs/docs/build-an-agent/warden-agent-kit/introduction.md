# Introduction

The Warden Agent Kit empowers AI Agents with the capability to seamlessly access both offchain and onchain functionalities. Built on the Warden Protocol, this toolkit enables agents to autonomously execute onchain interactions such as creating spaces, generating keys, facilitating transfers, and managing orders with support for arbitrary contract invocations. With our Agent Quickstart guide, you can have an AI Agent up and running using the Agent Kit in under 5 minutes.

The Warden Agent Kit provides the following features:

- Framework-agnostic design that seamlessly integrates with any AI Agent framework, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
- Native integration with Warden Protocol for autonomous onchain operations, such as smart contract interactions, transaction execution, and order management.
- Compatibility with LangChain and support for existing LangChain tools, enabling developers to leverage a rich ecosystem of AI and blockchain integrations.
- Customizable templates for extending and adding new functionalities tailored to specific use cases.
