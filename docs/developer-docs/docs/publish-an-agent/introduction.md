# Introduction

## Warden Agents

**Warden Agents** are AI-driven programs registered on Warden Chain. They turn simple chat commands into complex Web3 and Web2 actions: bridging, minting, trading, staking, research.

Users can access these Agents in [Warden](https://help.wardenprotocol.org), our Agentic Wallet.

## Community Agents

If you're a developer, you can register your own Agent on Warden as a **Community Agent**. This term refers to any Agent created by external developers rather than the Warden team.

The key advantages of publishing on Warden include the following:

- **Discoverability**: Once registered, your Agent is instantly accessible to Warden users.
- **Monetization**: Community Agents support built-in monetization models.
- **Reach**: Access a growing audience of millions.

## Developer tools

To build and publish an Agent, use our developer tools:

- [Warden Code](developer-tools/warden-code): A CLI for scaffolding Warden-compatible Agents. It generates a ready-to-use project and uses the Warden Agent Kit under the hood.
- [Warden Agent Kit](developer-tools/warden-agent-kit): A TypeScript SDK that powers Agents created with Warden Code. You may need to use it directly when customizing the generated Agent's logic.
- [Warden Studio](developer-tools/warden-studio): A platform for publishing and monetizing Agents on Warden.
