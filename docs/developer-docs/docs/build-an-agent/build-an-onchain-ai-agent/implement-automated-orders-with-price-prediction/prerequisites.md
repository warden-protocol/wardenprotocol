# Prerequisites

Before you start implementing automated Orders with price prediction, you need to follow the guides in this section:

- [Build the infrastructure for Orders](/category/build-the-infrastructure-for-orders)  
  **Note**: Ensure that you implement [a mock Async precompile](../build-the-infrastructure-for-orders/create-mock-precompiles#13-create-an-async-precompile).

You need to understand the following:

- Warden's prediction system based on the [`x/async` module](/learn/warden-protocol-modules/x-async)
- Price normalization between different sources
- Time-based contract constraints
- Complex state management
