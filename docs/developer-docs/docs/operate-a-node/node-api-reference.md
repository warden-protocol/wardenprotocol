# Node API reference

Warden Protocol nodes are central points of contact for Warden Protocol. They're responsible for routing requests to [Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain) and for routing responses back to the client.

There are two ways to communicate with a node:

- **HTTP API**, default port `1317`
- **gRPC API**, default port `9090`

You can find the HTTP API reference here:

- An autogenerated [OpenAPI spec for the HTTP API](/openapi.yml)
- A live version of SwaggerUI bundled with the Node: http://localhost:1317

**Note**: Since the HTTP API is based on the gRPC API, you can also use it as a quick reference. If you want to learn more, look at the Protobuf definitions in the [proto/](https://github.com/warden-protocol/wardenprotocol/tree/main/proto) directory.
