/**
 * `Visibility` restricts service consumer's access to service elements,
 * such as whether an application can call a visibility-restricted method.
 * The restriction is expressed by applying visibility labels on service
 * elements. The visibility labels are elsewhere linked to service consumers.
 *
 * A service can define multiple visibility labels, but a service consumer
 * should be granted at most one visibility label. Multiple visibility
 * labels for a single service consumer are not supported.
 *
 * If an element and all its parents have no visibility label, its visibility
 * is unconditionally granted.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     visibility:
 *       rules:
 *       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.EnhancedSearch
 *         restriction: PREVIEW
 *       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Delegate
 *         restriction: INTERNAL
 *
 * Here, all methods are publicly visible except for the restricted methods
 * EnhancedSearch and Delegate.
